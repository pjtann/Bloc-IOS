Markdown Message:


### Hey Steve,

>This is a markdown syntax example. I selected **Bloc** partly because of the:
 
* mentoring program
* the real world projects to build a portfolio and publish
* customized material they’ve developed
* and of course just best guess as to which program I might get the most benefit from.
 
I’m thinking of attending one of the [Nerd Ranch](www.bignerdranch.com) courses as a bootcamp once I get further along; they were _my other top consideration_ and of course a much `quicker jump start`.

Thanks,

**Peter T.**


Goals:

Hey Steve,

The following represents a potential list of goals that are not necessarily all encompassing, but will highlight some of the more obvious intentions:

* As much proficiency with Objective-C language and syntax as possible.
* As much proficiency with Swift language and syntax as possible.
* Understanding of how the components of Objective-C and Swift all interact and what types of code components to put where - solid design techniques.
* Not to focus on documentation or other supportive artifacts. I have produced IT documents for many years and wish to focus on learning the IOS programming languages.
* To have several applications published in the Apple store so I can display that I have them there in support of seeking and securing IOS development work.
* To have a portfolio of applications (some published as stated above) to support seeking  and securing IOS development work.
* To leave my day job.
* Have an organized set of sources that will support me in IOS development work. Cheat sheets, links, repeatable/reusable code snippets, etc.

Thanks,

Peter T.
